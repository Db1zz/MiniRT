# TODO List

Scene parser -	DONE
Shapes - plane, sphere, cylinder
Shape resize - diameter for a
	sphere and the width and height for a cylinder.
Translation and rotation transformation to
objects, lights and cameras (except for spheres and lights that cannot be rotated).
Camera - DONE
Light sources 
Light management: spot brightness, hard shadows, ambiance lighting (objects are
never completely in the dark). You must implement Ambient and diffuse lighting.
Shape list - DONE

# BUGS
	Fixed sphere rendering when the sphere does not have a 0,0,0 position

RayTracing - https://scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-ray-tracing/how-does-it-work.html


## Scene parser

◦ Your program must take as a first argument a scene description file with the .rt
extension.
◦ Each type of element can be separated by one or more line break(s).
◦ Each type of information from an element can be separated by one or more
space(s).
◦ Each type of element can be set in any order in the file.
◦ Elements which are defined by a capital letter can only be declared once in
the scene. [A(Ambient lightning), C(Camera), L(Light), sp(Sphere), pl(Plane), cy(Cylinder)]
◦ Each element first’s information is the type identifier (composed by one or two
character(s)), followed by all specific information for each object in a strict
order.
